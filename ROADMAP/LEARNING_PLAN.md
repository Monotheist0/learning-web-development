# 🧠 The Generation Mode Learning Contract

## 🎯 Goal
Transition from **Recognition** (understanding code when I see it) to **Generation** (knowing what to build and how to write it from scratch).

## 🛡️ The Rules of Engagement

### 1. The Rule of 15 (Struggle First)
- **Struggle for 15 minutes** before asking for the solution.
- Use documentation or previous "Days" (1-11) as references first.
- If help is needed, ask the AI for a **HINT** or a **Logic Explanation** first.
- **NO COPY-PASTING**: If code is provided, it must be manually re-typed to build muscle memory.

### 2. The Box-Logic Habit (Architecture First)
- BEFORE writing any code, describe the feature in plain English.
- Identify:
    - **The Box**: What components do we need?
    - **The Memory**: What state/data is required?
    - **The Wires**: How does data flow when an action happens?

### 3. The Daily Drill (Muscle Memory)
- Spend 10 minutes daily reconstructing a common pattern (useState, fetch, .map) in a blank file.
- Focus on speed and accuracy of syntax.

### 4. The Buddy Protocol (AI Behavior)
- AI must act as a **Mentor**, not a Generator.
- AI should prioritize explaining "Why" and "How" over just providing the "What."
- AI should ask "Reverse Interview" questions to verify understanding.

## 📅 Current Learning Status & Challenges (February 10, 2026)

### **Where I Actually Am (The "Architecture Wall"):**
-   **Timeline:** ~4 months total (HTML/CSS -> JS -> React).
-   **Skill Level:**
    -   **Syntax:** ✅ Good. Can read code and understand individual concepts (props, state, useEffect).
    -   **Logic:** ✅ Good. Can describe what needs to happen (e.g., "pass empty string to clear").
    -   **Generation:** ❌ Struggling. Blank file anxiety. Hard time visualizing "The Wires" from scratch.
    -   **Architecture:** ❌ Difficulty connecting independent concepts into a cohesive system without guidance.
-   **The Core Battle:**
    -   **"Read-Only" Brain:** High comprehension (Recognition) but low retention for writing (Generation).
    -   **AI Dependency:** Relying on AI to "write" the solution instead of just "planning" the structure.
    -   **Tutorial Fatigue:** Overwhelmed by infrastructure (Postgres/Git) when the goal is learning Logic.

## ✅ The "Generation Mode" Recovery Plan (4-Week Focus)

**Goal:** Break the "Copy-Paste" loop. Move to Next.js, but change **HOW** we learn.

### 1. The "Fade-Out" Protocol (AI Interaction)
We will change how you prompt the AI. You are forbidden from asking "Write code for X."
*   **Level 1 (Current):** "Write a search bar component." (⛔ STOP DOING THIS)
*   **Level 2 (The New Standard):** "I need a search bar. What variables do I need to track? Don't write the JSX, just list the steps."
*   **Level 3 (Goal):** "Here is my plan for the search bar. Does this data flow make sense?"

### 2. The "Box-Logic" Diagram (Before Code)
You cannot write code until you can "draw" it in plain English.
*   **Box:** What is the component?
*   **Memory:** What data lives here? (State)
*   **Wires:** Who does it talk to? (Props/Events)
*   *Drill:* Spend 5 minutes drawing the feature on paper/Excalidraw before opening VS Code.

### 3. The "Manual Override" Rule
*   **Absolutely NO Copy-Pasting Code.**
*   If the AI gives you a snippet, you must **read it, hide it, and type it from memory**.
*   If you forget syntax, peek for 2 seconds, hide it again, and type. This forces your brain to "hold" the syntax.

### 4. Next.js Strategy
*   We will move to Next.js to get a "fresh start."
*   We will ignore complex infrastructure (Postgres) for the first week and focus purely on **Layouts, Pages, and Data Flow** (using fake JSON data).
*   **Focus:** "How do I pass data from a Page to a Component?" (The Wires).
